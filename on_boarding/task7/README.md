**Flutter E-Commerce App****
This Flutter project is developed as part of an internship at A2SV, focusing on learning Flutter development using Test Driven Development (TDD), Clean Architecture, and the BLoC pattern.

Project Overview
The application aims to demonstrate Clean Architecture principles through practical implementation, enhancing code maintainability, scalability, and testability.

**Architecture**
Clean Architecture
The project is structured into multiple layers:
**
**Presentation Layer:****
Widgets: UI components.
BLoC: Manages application state.
**Domain Layer:**
Entities: Core business classes.
Use Cases: Business logic implementation.
**Data Layer:**
**Repositories**: Data handling operations.
Data Sources: Implementations for data operations.
Data Flow
**User Interaction**: Interacts with the UI.
Event Triggering: UI triggers events sent to BLoC.
**BLoC Processing**: Processes events and interacts with Use Cases.
Use Case Execution: Fetches/updates data via Repositories.
Data Source Interaction: Interacts with Data Sources.
State Update: Returns results to BLoC.
State Emission: Emits new state to UI.

Test Driven Development (TDD)
The project follows TDD principles with unit, widget, and integration tests for each layer.

**Dependencies**
flutter_bloc: State management with BLoC.
provider: Dependency injection.
get_it: Service locator pattern.
mockito: Mocking dependencies in tests.
flutter_test: For writing tests.
Flutter UI Design Implementation
